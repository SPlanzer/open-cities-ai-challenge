# Open Cities AI Challenge benchmark model
Benchmark model for DrivenData Open Cities AI Challenge

This repository is designed to be a resource for contestants of [DrivenData's Open Cities AI Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/60/building-segmentation-disaster-resilience/page/150/). The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can segment out buildings from aerial imagery of several African cities. The code and documentation contained here demonstrate how to train a model and make predictions on the competition data using [Raster Vision](https://rastervision.io/).

## Raster Vision
Raster Vision is an python framework that makes it easy to implement existing backend deep learning frameworks for computer vision tasks that use satellite, aerial and other large format imagery. To learn more about what Raster Vision can do, check out [the docs](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.9/) or [this blog post](https://www.azavea.com/blog/2018/10/18/raster-vision-release/) announcing its release. If you are interested in tutorials on using Raster Vision outside the context of this competition, there are several examples in the [raster-vision-examples repo](https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision-examples).
